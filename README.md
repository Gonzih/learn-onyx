# lambdajam-2015

Onyx workshop materials for the LambdaJam 2015 conference. This workshop assumes attendees were at the Onyx talk earlier in the day and are familiar with the basic concepts.

### How this works

This repository contains a set of tests that can be invoked with `lein test`. The workshop is divided into levels and challenges. Each level is dedicated to a particular Onyx feature. Each level has several challenges that you can work through. Every challenge is self contained in its own test (named `test_<level>_<challenge>.clj` and implementation file (named `challenge_<level>_<challenge>`). Every level has a "challenge 0". This challenge is already-working, and is a basic example of how to use the feature under discussion to help you get started.

### Guide

  - Challenge 1: Implement a catalog entry for a function
  - Challenge 2: Parameterize a function through the catalog
  - Challenge 3: Implement a stateful grouping task
