# lambdajam-2015

Onyx workshop materials for the LambdaJam 2015 conference. This workshop assumes attendees were at the Onyx talk earlier in the day and are familiar with the basic concepts.

### How this works

This repository contains a set of tests that can be invoked with `lein test`. The workshop is divided into levels and challenges. Each level is dedicated to a particular Onyx feature, and is meant to focus your attention in one or two points of the code to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Each level has several challenges that you can work through. Every challenge is self contained in its own test (named `test_<level>_<challenge>.clj` and implementation file (named `challenge_<level>_<challenge>`). Every level has a "challenge 0". This challenge is already-working, and is a basic example of how to use the feature under discussion to help you get started. It should be useful as a base for experimentation if you want to start from a known-good state and push outwards into new ideas.
