# lambdajam-2015

Onyx workshop materials for the LambdaJam 2015 conference. This workshop assumes attendees were at the Onyx talk earlier in the day and are familiar with the basic concepts.

### How this works

This repository contains a set of tests that can be invoked with `lein test`. The workshop is divided into levels and challenges. Each level is dedicated to a particular Onyx feature. Each level has several challenges that you can work through. Every challenge is self contained in its own test and implementation file. Every level has a "challenge 0". This challenge is already-working, and is a basic example of how to use the feature under discussion to help you get started.

### Guide

- Level 0: Sanity Check
  - Challenge 0: Makes sure your environment is working okay
- Level 1: Workflows
  - Challenge 0: A minimal workflow
  - Challenge 1: Implement a linear workflow
  - Challenge 2: Implement a branched workflow
  - Challenge 3: Implement a larger DAG workflow
